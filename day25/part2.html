<article class="day-desc"><h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>Suddenly, the experimental antenna control console lights up:</p>
<pre><code><em>Sleigh keys detected!</em></code></pre>
<p>According to the console, the keys are <em>directly under the submarine</em>. <span title="Thanks to the deep-sea marine biologist, who apparently works at the Biham-Middleton-Levine oceanic research institute.">You landed</span> right on them! Using a robotic arm on the submarine, you move the sleigh keys into the airlock.</p>
<p>Now, you just need to get them to Santa in time to save Christmas! You check your clock - it <em>is</em> Christmas. There's no way you can get them back to the surface in time.</p>
<p>Just as you start to lose hope, you notice a button on the sleigh keys: <em>remote start</em>. You can start the sleigh from the bottom of the ocean! You just need some way to <em>boost the signal</em> from the keys so it actually reaches the sleigh. Good thing the submarine has that experimental antenna! You'll definitely need <em class="star">50 stars</em> to boost it that far, though.</p>
<p>The experimental antenna control console lights up again:</p>
<pre><code><em>Energy source detected.
Integrating energy source from device "sleigh keys"...done.
Installing device drivers...done.
Recalibrating experimental antenna...done.
Boost strength due to matching signal phase: <em class="star">1 star</em>
</em></code></pre>
<p>Only <em class="star">49 stars</em> to go.</p>
