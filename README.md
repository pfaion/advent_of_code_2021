# Advent of Code 2021

My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in 2021.

- All solutions are written for Python 3.10 (I wanted to explore the new features).
- Each solution is a stand-alone Python script (no code re-use or modules).
- No external libraries are used, but I tried finding and using appropriate standard-library function.
- For each day folder, the exercise text and solutions are copied together into a single README for easy viewing (with `make_nice.py`).
