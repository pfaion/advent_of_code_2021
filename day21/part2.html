<article class="day-desc"><h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>Now that you're warmed up, it's time to play the real game.</p>
<p>A second compartment opens, this time labeled <em>Dirac dice</em>. Out of it falls a single three-sided die.</p>
<p>As you experiment with the die, you feel a little strange. An informational brochure in the compartment explains that this is a <em>quantum die</em>: when you roll it, the universe <em>splits into multiple copies</em>, one copy for each possible outcome of the die. In this case, rolling the die always splits the universe into <em>three copies</em>: one where the outcome of the roll was <code>1</code>, one where it was <code>2</code>, and one where it was <code>3</code>.</p>
<p>The game is played the same as before, although to prevent things from getting too far out of hand, the game now ends when either player's score reaches at least <code><em>21</em></code>.</p>
<p>Using the same starting positions as in the example above, player 1 wins in <code><em>444356092776315</em></code> universes, while player 2 merely wins in <code>341960390180808</code> universes.</p>
<p>Using your given starting positions, determine every possible outcome. <em>Find the player that wins in more universes; in how many universes does that player win?</em></p>
