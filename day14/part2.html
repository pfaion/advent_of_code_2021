<article class="day-desc"><h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>The resulting polymer isn't nearly strong enough to reinforce the submarine. You'll need to run more steps of the pair insertion process; a total of <em>40 steps</em> should do it.</p>
<p>In the above example, the most common element is <code>B</code> (occurring <code>2192039569602</code> times) and the least common element is <code>H</code> (occurring <code>3849876073</code> times); subtracting these produces <code><em>2188189693529</em></code>.</p>
<p>Apply <em>40</em> steps of pair insertion to the polymer template and find the most and least common elements in the result. <em>What do you get if you take the quantity of the most common element and subtract the quantity of the least common element?</em></p>
