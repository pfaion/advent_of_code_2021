<article class="day-desc"><h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>On the other hand, it might be wise to try a different strategy: <span title="That's 'cuz a submarine don't pull things' antennas out of their sockets when they lose. Giant squid are known to do that.">let the giant squid win</span>.</p>
<p>You aren't sure how many bingo boards a giant squid could play at once, so rather than waste time counting its arms, the safe thing to do is to <em>figure out which board will win last</em> and choose that one. That way, no matter which boards it picks, it will win for sure.</p>
<p>In the above example, the second board is the last to win, which happens after <code>13</code> is eventually called and its middle column is completely marked. If you were to keep playing until this point, the second board would have a sum of unmarked numbers equal to <code>148</code> for a final score of <code>148 * 13 = <em>1924</em></code>.</p>
<p>Figure out which board will win last. <em>Once it wins, what would its final score be?</em></p>
